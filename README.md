# analyzing-for-sail-boat-speed
this is the code to calculate the relationship sail shape and boat speed. I am using a raspberry pi 3 model B+ for catching the sail shape and boat speed. I think definitely this is the first approach  for optimizing a sailing techniche!

# this is the step for it
1.Catch photos of sail applied to circle marks by using camera in raspberry pi every seconds.
2.Calculate oordinates of each mark by using Python with OpenCV modele.
3.At the same time, catch the boat speed from GPS modelue.
4.calculate the relationship between 2. and 3. 
5.finnaly, I can realize how the max speed of the boat is. If the sail shape does not match the max speed, this machin will show the difference on screen on boat.
